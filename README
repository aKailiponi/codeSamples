Hi this repository is simply a place where I will dump sample code written by myself to be referenced by whoever is intersted. 
If you have any questions simply send an e-mail to akailiponi@gmail.com and I would be happy to answer them.

USING THE HTML SAMPLE:
place license.xhtml, licensecode.js, and style.css into the same folder. Open license.xhtml with any browser.
